Create reference table
New->Reference Table->Reference Table as empty->(provide name)->(add two attributes and check valid button for one attributes)->(push "data" button and enter valid values)->
New->Reference Table->Reference Table from flat file->(provide name)->(check the valid value box)->finish

Create a Rule
Rule does not use active transformation

New->Mapplet->
add a parser->go to property->add a strategy->select input port->choose reference tab->add output attributes->check replace matches with valid values->validate as Rule


Parser:
we can parse any number of input through a parser transformation
Token Based
Pattern Based

Property->Add Strategy->provide name->select input port->Parse using Token Set(Parse using Reference Table)->Regular Expression(for multiple outputs. Token Set for single output)->provide regular expression name->next->provide number of ports for this regular expression->provide regular expression->next->provide output names for the regular expression

There is an email parser for Regular Expression

Create reusable regular expression/Token Set
New->Content Set->(provide content set name)->push Content button->Choose "Regular Expression" or "Token Set"->Add->


PATTERN BASED PARSER:
use labeler first to create labler data since we need two inputs for pattern based parser


lookup

08. Informatica Data Quality by Sudhakarreddy

delete am empty line
sed '/^$/d' 

delete last line:
sed '$d' 

04. Informatica data quality Parser and standardizer transformation
PARSER TRANSFORMATION





Regulare Expression:
([a-zA-Z]+)\|([A-Z](2))\|([A-Z](2,3)]
^(19|20)[0-9]{2}_

(foo|bar)[0-9]+

Create reusable token set: New->content set->content-Regular Expression->Add

PATTERN/TOKEN BASED PARSER TRANSFORMATION
<1>Partten based parser transformation requires two inputs:
   use label transformation for the input

Case converter
merger same as concate

standarizer transformaion:
Properties->(Provide a Name)->Strategies->Add->(provider a name)->(See below options)
a. remove reference table matches values
b. remove customer strings(can remove a lot of funny characters at one shot)
c. remove reference table matches with valid values
d. replace reference table matches with custom strings
e. replace custom strings
->


IDQ:
Create IDQ workflow
Create application:
add application to the newly created application
deploy application


Rules:
only active transformation can not be used for a rule, while mapplet can use both.
If an active tranformation is added, it can not be validate as a rule
to create a rule by creating a mapplet
from reference table
validate the mapplet as a rule

open profile->Defination->column profiling(Rules)->Add->(Browse Rules and provide source fields)



05. Informatica data quality Decision, case converter and Labeler transformation by sudhakarreddy

decision transformation:
Need to make sure input ports and out ports are created already created before add Strategy

IF
in_CUST_TIER='Diamond' THEN
Membership_type='Prime'
Percentage_discount=25
elsif
in_Cust_TIER='Gold' THEN
Membership_type='SemiPrime'
Percentage_discount=15
else
Membership_type='General'
Percentage_discount=15
endif

Labeler transformation:
Strategis->Add Strategy->Select Input ports->(check Charaters for Mode)->Next->(Select Label Character using character set)

Create a content set for character

Type of Contents:
Informatica distribute the following types of contents:
Accelerator package: Accelerators plus reference data
Address Doctor reference data files
Identify population files

The content install does not include addres reference data files of identify population files. You purchase this content separately. You raise a Shipping SR to ge the Address Doctor and Identify population files

Pre- Requisites:
InformaticaPowerCenter Repository and Integration Service up and running
InformaticaPowerCenter Web Service Provider Valid License
Administrative privileges to create Web Service Hub

Why use HTTP Transformation
Alternative to webservice consumer transformation when no license available for PowerExchange for Webservices
Access RESTful Webservice scein WSC transformation supports only SOAP webservices in powercenter

HTTP SOAP request in XML need to be created and input the http SOAPRequest field

SOAP UI

(Create Web Service Source)->Web Service Consumer Properties->Populate SOAP Request
